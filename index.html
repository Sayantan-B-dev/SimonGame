        <strong>Simon Game Rules</strong><br/>
        The Simon Game is a memory-based challenge where players must repeat an ever-increasing sequence of lights and sounds. The rules are as follows:<br/>
        <hr/>
        1. <i><u>Starting the Game:</u></i> The game begins with a simple pattern consisting of a sequence of colored lights and sounds.<br/>

        2. <i><u>Sequence Playback:</u></i> A color is randomly chosen, and a sound is played corresponding to that color.<br/>

        3. <i><u>Player's Turn:</u></i> The player must repeat the sequence by pressing the colored buttons in the exact order presented.<br/>

        4. <i><u>Increasing Difficulty:</u></i> With each successful repetition, the game adds one more color to the sequence, making the pattern longer and more complex.<br/>

        5. <i><u>Game Over:</u></i> If the player fails to repeat the sequence correctly, the game ends, and the player is shown their final score, typically reflecting the longest sequence they successfully completed.<br/>

        6. <i><u>Objective:</u></i> The goal is to memorize and correctly repeat the longest possible sequence of colors without making any mistakes.<br/>
