# SimonGame
Rules are written on the game itself when it is run through the github diployment.
There is only the html,css,js files that are required so you can just download them ,put them in a same folder and run the html.
This project is not entirely mine since it was a part of Angela Yu's course on Udemy.
But i changed quite a lot of features into it like custom sounds,rework done in HTML&CSS,tweeking the logics in JS,adding ruleson the page,visual animations on the buytton.
All together it was a great project as a part of my practice during that time.
